This project was completed using the following:  

- HTML  
- CSS (SaSS)  
- Bootstrap  
- Vanilla Javascript  

Users should be able to:  

- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)  
- If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.  
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size  
- See hover states for button  

I am particularly proud of my use of objects in the javascript portion of this project. Lately much of my javascript practice had been centered around objects and I was happy to find a practical use for this knowledge. The code creates a price class and uses that class to store objects in an array. Each object element in priceStructure array represents a billing tier consisting of two properties (views, price). The slider value calls on these different objects and displays the correct values.
